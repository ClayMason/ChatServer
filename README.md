# ChatServer
This is a chat server used to communicate with a websocket created by a client. This chat server handles the parsing of the
websocket handshake to establish the connection with the websocket and unpack/pack messages sent from/to the client.

Reference to the websocket handshake format can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API/Writing_WebSocket_servers#Exchanging_data_frames).
